# rust-tools
This project is to help me learn the Rust programming language. This project will contain basic CLI tools written in Rust for learning purposes
as well as various data structures and or utilities.  Basically this is a catch-all project for everything I do while learning rust.  I originally
created this project and then got busy and didn't have the time to invest in learning Rust but now I do.
